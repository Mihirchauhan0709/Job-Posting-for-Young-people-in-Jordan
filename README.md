# Job Posting Dashboard for Jordan üåç

This project was developed during a Data Science Hackathon at my university. The goal was to tackle the challenge of youth unemployment in Jordan by creating an intuitive dashboard using Power BI to help young job seekers easily find relevant job opportunities.

## Problem Statement
Youth in Jordan face difficulties finding job openings tailored to their needs. Our solution was to create a dashboard that visualizes job availability, categorizes opportunities by district, enterprise size, and job role, and simplifies the search process.
